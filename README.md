# Sudoku-Generator-and-Solver
Sudoku Generator and Solver, built in Java, employs a backtracking algorithm to create and solve puzzles. The generator fills the grid, removes numbers, and ensures a single solution, offering unique challenges. The solver tries numbers in empty cells and backtracks when conflicts arise, efficiently finding solutions.
